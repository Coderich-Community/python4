# Add a library reference (import the library) to your Python project.

To add a library reference to your Python project, you can use the `pip` command. For example, to install the Spire.XLS for Python library, you would run the following command:

```sh
pip install Spire.Xls
```

Once the library is installed, you can import it into your Python script using the `import` keyword.
